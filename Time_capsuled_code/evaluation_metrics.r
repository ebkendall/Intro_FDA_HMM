# Obtain 95% Credible sets for the transition rate parameters and variance terms

# Obtain 95% Credible sets and coverage probabilities for the true function values

# Average (or Expected) mean square error 

# Run the MCMC on 100 datasets each with K in 5:20, and then P1 = 95-80

# Mean integrated square error
